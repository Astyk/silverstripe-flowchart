#Silverstripe Flowchart

> Prototype for a graphical flowchart creator within Silverstripe

Implementation of JSPlumb to create and store graphical flowcharts within SilverStripe

## Built with JSPlumb

http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/

## Approach
1. Enter data in a gridfield on the FlowchartPage type
2. Manually construct drawings with that data in a ModelAdmin

## TODO
* Better user feedback in the CMS around saving a graphical flowchart (change button names, add save and publish)
* A better way to link to other states (treedropdown, or filtered somehow...)
